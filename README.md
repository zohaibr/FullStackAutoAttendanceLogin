# FullStack Auto Login Chrome Extension

Daily attendance is mandatory for the FullStack Academy's Web Immservive program and requires the students to login to the portal while on campus to mark their attendance.

FullStack Auto Login Chrome Extension runs in the background and checks if *the user is within 100 meters of the FullStack campus and hasn't logged in the last 8 hours*.

If the conditions are true, then a new tab is launched with the FullStack Academy's portal.

**This Chrome Extension was created as part of the Stackathon (Two day Hackathon) at FullStack Academy.**

It's an ongoing work in progress.
  ..* Refactor code for better async structure.
  ..* Add the ability to change the address for FullStack campus
  ..* Add functionality to only run once a day and reduce the background functionality to the minimum.
